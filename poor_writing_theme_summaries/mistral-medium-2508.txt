mistral-medium-2508’s worst writing failures come from a consistent tradeoff: it optimizes for poetic “beats” and symbolic callbacks at the sentence and paragraph level, but it doesn’t maintain a stable scene ledger of who holds what, where bodies are, what time it is, and what rules are currently binding. The result is not subtle ambiguity but hard continuity breaks that read like the author forgot what they just wrote. You see it in pure prop teleportation: “The prism in his pocket grew warm…” followed immediately by “the prism glowed on the dashboard…,” or in chain-of-custody knots where an object is simultaneously handled, stashed, and returned without any transfer verbs. Because the model treats paragraph breaks as soft resets, it will confidently restate a new “take” of the scene rather than reconcile the previous one, producing contradictions like “They walked out together, leaving the music box behind…” and then “The pin… gleamed in the dirt…” as if the physical layout has been re-rolled.

The same mechanism shows up as rulebook wobble: the model likes absolutist thesis lines because they sound literary and decisive, but then it reverts to default narrative conveniences when it needs plot or emotion. That’s how you get a premise like “too raw to lie…” and then, without reframing, a clean lie that lands: “The storm took the rest.” The high-severity examples repeat this pattern across physics, biology, and environment constraints, especially when the prose “upshifts” into wonder. It will assert near-void conditions—“air inside had long since thinned”—and then proceed with ordinary respiration: “She exhaled, watching her breath fog the glass…” Or it will cash a striking physical image without paying the plausibility cost, like “Lira’s shadow stretched long… though the aurora cast no light to make it.” The problem isn’t imagination; it’s that the model treats these claims as mood-signals, not commitments that downstream generation must enforce.

When narrative pressure rises—escapes, heists, final reveals—this model also drops causal bridges. It often jumps from setup straight to the desired emotional state, skipping the intermediate mechanics that would make the change feel earned. That’s why resolutions arrive as authorial teleportation: “The star fragment… plunging into the dark” becomes “she found the fragment waiting… in the palm of a statue’s…” with no depicted path, agent, or constraint. Even when it states a rule for how a mechanism works, it may omit the required action at payoff, turning the climax into a declarative vanishing act rather than a caused event. This is closely related to the prop drift: if you don’t track where the fragment is, you also can’t show how it gets from falling to being placed; the model substitutes a resonant “final image” for the missing chain.

Time and space anchoring errors are the scene-scale version of the same state-tracking deficit. The model composes in vivid vignette units and then stitches them together with minimal connective tissue, so tense and temporal prediction collide: “The first body would be found at noon…” sits next to “The prisoners would be found soon…” and then “The bodies were found at noon…” after a hard break. Spatial nouns likewise slide without transitions, yielding contradictions as blunt as “rooftop garden” alongside “the city below had no towers left—only… the old lighthouse…,” which makes readers stop and ask what world they are in. These discontinuities spike when the story uses montage phrasing (“by dawn,” “when she woke,” “soon”) or cross-cuts between inside/outside spaces, because the model treats each cut as a fresh staging opportunity rather than an update to a continuous map.

Finally, there’s a smaller but high-impact layer of sentence-level instability that makes the big structural issues feel even less trustworthy. At climactic lines, token selection sometimes drifts into malformed verb forms or nonwords the model doesn’t repair: “Still *initiate*.” and “The canyon *inhale*—not wind…” land exactly where the prose most needs to be clean. Importantly, this isn’t separate from the other failures; it’s the same style-over-substance bias under compression. When the model is trying to be maximally punchy—tight ending, high concept, lyrical turn—it spends its probability budget on evocative phrasing and callbacks, and it under-spends on bookkeeping: prop ownership, rule enforcement, environmental plausibility, and the one concrete mechanism sentence that would keep the reader oriented.
