Command‑a’s worst failures come from a strong bias toward landing a “poetic closure beat” even when it hasn’t built the causal scaffolding to earn it. Under pressure—especially near endings or tight word limits—it behaves like a goal-seeking summarizer: it introduces a locked situation, then skips the enabling steps and snaps straight to payoff. That’s why crises evaporate in a single clause, as in “the chains fell away, as if they had never been there.” The same shortcut shows up in puzzle/quest frames where an artifact is treated as a universal bypass: “fit perfectly into a small groove she hadn’t noticed before,” or “drawn by an unseen force… until the crystal ball was whole once more.” In these moments the model is optimizing for the feeling of resolution, not for a sequence of constraints, attempts, costs, and consequences. The result is that stakes are declared, then quietly invalidated, so the reader experiences the climax as author fiat rather than character agency.

A second, tightly related problem is that command‑a does not reliably maintain a world-state ledger across sentences, so it overwrites earlier commitments when a later line wants a familiar trope or motif. This is continuity failure at the mechanism level: local sentence generation wins over global bookkeeping. You see it in object handoffs that reverse themselves without retrieval (“She handed him the empty hourglass…” followed by “Using the hourglass as a focal point, Mara…”), and in outright contradictions that collapse the premise, like “She clutched the antique watch fob in her pocket…” paired with “had been left behind as a taunt…” and then “I need to know who took it.” It’s the same state-tracking weakness that makes a unique bolt both structural and removed—“its bench held together by a single, rusted bolt.” but also “rested a single object: the piano bench bolt…”—or lets a “traded her voice” hook coexist with spoken dialogue. This isn’t just sloppiness; it’s what happens when motif persistence (keep the cool object/phrase in play) outranks continuity constraints.

Those bookkeeping gaps combine with an under-simulated physical world model. Command‑a will assemble vivid images independently—submerged libraries, moonlit summits, quills and inkwells, molten glass—without running a constraint check across medium, materials, bodies, and time. That’s why it can write “Hours passed, the moon’s slow orbit bringing the first hint of dawn…” on a lunar summit, or stage writing in water—“He dipped the quill into the ink… a stark contrast to the murky water.”—without bridging facts like an air pocket, suit, workspace, or timescale. When it needs an action setpiece, it sometimes papers over impossibility with a placeholder rationale (“through some inexplicable connection”), producing scenes like “The duel began… Kael faced the brain…” where the core action can’t be simulated under the story’s own prior conditions. The reader’s trust breaks because the environment stops acting like an environment and starts acting like a stage that rearranges itself for the next beat.

Style is not merely decoration here; it actively drives the failures. Command‑a reaches for “literary” abstraction early and often, and those abstractions can become self-reinforcing motifs that displace concrete staging. Refrains like “The air was thick with an ambered hush…” or “the bronze quiet of forgotten eras…” are easy for the model to repeat, but they don’t anchor space, causality, or sensory reality; they can even introduce contradictions (“a crashing hush”) that feel clever in isolation and incoherent in sequence. When the model can’t make a plot transition work, it sometimes switches to brochure-like thesis statements—“The motivation that had driven her for years…” or “Her motivation was clear: to wavelength align with purpose”—which read like an author note pasted into the story to compensate for missing dramatized choices. At the sentence level, the same style-over-substance bias yields malformed phrasing (“to quilts memories together…”, “Her role was to hymning the mundane…”) that signals the model is blending templates (poetic, technical, bureaucratic) without selecting one coherent register.

These issues are connected by shared triggers and a single underlying trade: command‑a prioritizes immediate aesthetic payoff and motif continuity over constraint satisfaction. When it introduces a “key artifact” or a mystical/technical explanation late, it’s especially prone to letting that element dissolve the need for intermediate steps, which in turn increases pressure on state tracking and physics. If it can’t justify a transition, it either teleports (“Maya began her journey back to the surface” after an exit is sealed) or handwaves mechanism with jargon that sounds authoritative but doesn’t constrain outcomes (“preprocess reality,” “Through synaptic plasticity…”). The engineering intuition is that the model lacks a robust, persistent internal checklist for “what must remain true,” so it uses language-level plausibility—poetic paradox, technobabble, motivational slogans—to mask missing causal links. That mask works for a sentence or two, but at severity‑7+ it fails visibly because the story’s objects, rules, and stakes stop behaving like a system and start behaving like a sequence of desired endings.
