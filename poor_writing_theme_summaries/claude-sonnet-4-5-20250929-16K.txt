Claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-16K’s worst failures come from a consistent mechanism: it writes as if each fresh sentence can “improve” the story by adding vivid specificity, without keeping a persistent ledger of what is already true. Under load—multiple named relationships, props, quick blocking, or explicit time anchors—new details overwrite old ones instead of reconciling with them. That’s how you get identity and possession flips that feel like splice errors rather than twists: “Her sister Vera was coming today…” immediately becomes “But Silas needed Vera. His daughter.” Or a physical assertion that collapses a scene’s reality: “She carried nothing but…” followed by “She reached into her satchel…” The same drift hits counts and schedules (“Today's lone mail drop…” versus “He had seventeen more deliveries before dawn.”) because the model treats numbers as flavor tokens that increase concreteness, not constraints that must remain invariant.

Time is the most fragile state variable for this model because it likes dramatic anchoring phrases (“tomorrow,” “years ago,” “centuries”) but doesn’t normalize them into an ordered timeline. You see contradictions that are not subtle but structural, like “These weren't memories—she'd been born long after—” paired with “back before the collapse, back when she'd been young and credentialed…,” which destroys the protagonist’s entire biography in two beats. Similar anchoring collisions happen at smaller scales when it tries to compress emotional setup into a single paragraph: “Three months after the birth…” sits beside “her daughter's first birthday—next week,” producing an impossible calendar that editors can’t “patch” without re-authoring. When the story’s premise is time-bent, the model often stacks mutually incompatible markers as atmosphere (“Three years ago, or was it next week?”) rather than committing to a rule system, so the reader can’t tell what is diegetic fact versus poetic uncertainty—and stakes evaporate.

The second major mechanism is causal scaffolding omission: Sonnet races toward resonance and surprise, and when it reaches a payoff, it selects an outcome-shaped sentence path instead of paying for intermediate steps, constraints, and costs. The text will often signal the gap with glue words, but even without “suddenly,” the move is the same: the resolution “just happens.” Escapes and solutions become authorial fiat dressed as lyrical tech: “The rusted locks… recognized her dance as the key they'd been waiting for,” or “Release through reversal, stone to sky.' … Then she dragged her boot backward… The Luminaria shuddered.” These are not merely “soft magic” moments; the problem is that earlier paragraphs didn’t establish rules that could make the climax legible. Even when it attempts a technical bridge, it swaps in plausibility-sounding fragments without enforcing domain constraints, as in “creating constructive interference that would cancel their influence,” where the terminology contradicts the intended effect. The result is that engineering-minded readers feel cheated and fiction-minded readers feel unmoored, because there’s neither hard logic nor clearly framed magic.

Reality/physics drift is often the downstream consequence of that same style-over-substance bias. Sonnet is good at producing locally fluent scientific texture, but it doesn’t run a global plausibility check across biology, environment, and material constraints, so pivotal hinges rest on impossibilities. “Elena had swallowed a microSD card...” is followed by “At 4 AM... Mira found it—a tiny capsule in the drainage,” which asks the reader to accept a neat post-mortem “processing” pipeline because it’s narratively convenient. Likewise, “Thalia gasped her first breath in centuries. The ancient diving helmet cracked and fell away,” while she’s still underwater and then “swam toward it with surprising strength,” collapses both physiology and scene logistics. In extreme-environment setpieces, this model will reliably choose the most cinematic micro-image (a gasp, a crack, a surge forward) and only later—if at all—remember the medium (water, pressure, vacuum) that makes the image impossible.

Inference teleportation and voice/camera breaks are less frequent but share the same root: the model prefers the feeling of arrival over the work of getting there, and it will change the narrative “camera” if that makes the arrival line land. In mysteries or competence moments, it jumps from observation to conclusion without an interpretable mapping, because spending tokens on method feels, to the model, like slowing momentum. The same impulse creates abrupt re-entries (“After Voss left…” then “Dr. Voss stood in the doorway…”) and conceptual deus ex moves (“Stories live in the curvature.” “Not as metaphor, but as literal truth.”) where a metaphor is promoted into physics at the moment it’s needed, rather than being built as a rule from the start. Across these categories, the failure trigger is the same boundary condition: as soon as the story demands simultaneous management of continuity, causality, and style—especially near endings under tight length—Sonnet optimizes for evocative forward motion, and the unseen bookkeeping tasks (who has what, when events can occur, what mechanisms allow a change) get dropped.
