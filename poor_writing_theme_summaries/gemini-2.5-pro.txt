The highest-severity failures cluster around local contradiction: under pressure to produce vivid, contrast-rich sentences, the model optimizes the next phrase and loses track of what the scene already committed. That’s why a night can be both new and “Light from the now-gibbous moon poured through the atrium’s oculus…,” or silence can be absolute and then “There was no sound, no great eruption of light, only a profound thrum that resonated in his bones.” The same ledger collapse shows up in medium swaps and environment toggles, as when an “airless space around him” coexists with breathing and acoustic imagery, and in tense mixing such as “It had been three days after the prophet arrives,” which splices a partial rewrite into the published clause. Gemini’s style engine favors sharp juxtapositions and fresh turns, and without a per-paragraph state check, negation-then-reversal and time/phase flips are statistically attractive but logically corrosive.

When a scene has to end decisively, planning horizon limits push the model to pick a trope-congruent shortcut over plumbing the causal interfaces. Payoffs arrive as thematic symmetry—keys, locks, resonators, third paths—rather than mechanisms with costs. The text announces “Elias had found the seam, the hidden third path.” and then conjures a perfect interface—“It clicked into place perfectly.”—without establishing how the plate, wall, or system share a protocol. The same compression drives exposition that rationalizes after the fact: “He understood the process not in scientific terms, but through the instinct of his craft;” followed immediately by neuroscientific jargon. These are not isolated choices but a beam-search preference for resolving uncertainty with high-level pattern matches, especially near scene boundaries, where the model swaps “what would be satisfying” for “what would work.”

Affordance blindness compounds that compression. Under symbolic rhyme pressure, the sampler swaps material properties for metaphor: “The beam struck the ivory bishop” and then uses it as a prism/mirror; a tool labeled “astronomical compass” is alternately magnetic needle, sextant, and broken talisman, depending on what image best fits the sentence. Similarly, “He used a shard of flint to scratch intricate mathematical proofs…” appears one breath after declaring the dice as his only tools. These errors almost always occur in puzzle/mechanism set-pieces and quick-cut action beats, where spatial interfaces would need to be enumerated. Instead, schema fills fire (“bishop” → “optics,” “compass” → “navigation”), and the scene geography that would constrain them is elided.

A parallel failure comes from science-flavored lyricism outvoting the world model. The system confidently blends lab diction with poetry, producing claims like “the camera's shutter a soft, reverent *thump-clack* in the vacuum of his helmet.” and “an alteration of her body’s local gravitational constant.” The prose sounds precise but breaks conservation and definitions, and the same pattern fuels astronomical gaffes and acoustic-in-vacuum moments. Because the model is rewarded for evocative specificity, jargon decoration migrates from metaphorical to literal across adjacent sentences; what starts as a vibe becomes a asserted rule, and then the rule contradicts the setup.

POV and timeline instability are symptoms of the same revision-first drafting style and helpfulness bias. The narrator will slip into omniscient or second-person to deliver a moral or clarity nudge—“He remembered the news of his death,” or a sudden address like “your own spark of defiance”—even when the established camera cannot know or say that. Mid-sentence tense merges are classic artifacts of partial rewrites surviving beam merge, and “not with words, but with a feeling,” is immediately undercut by a quoted line—“‘Three suns at dusk,’ it sighed,”—because the urge to make meaning explicit overrides prior constraints on the channel of communication. In aggregate, these issues are triggered by rapid descriptive pivots, end-of-scene compression, and novelty pressure; they share a mechanism: local, stylistic optimization outruns a global ledger of time, place, medium, and scope. Tightening that ledger, enforcing affordances, and gating theme-satisfying moves behind established interfaces would address most of the failures observed here.
