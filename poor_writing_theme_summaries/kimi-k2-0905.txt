Kimi-k2-0905 writes at the clause level with vivid, self-sufficient images, but its planning horizon is only a couple of sentences, so previously asserted facts decay as soon as a new image offers higher novelty. This is why props teleport, reconstitute, or split identities when a beat is revised for effect. You see it in hard continuity breaks such as “I placed the shell on a projector’s feed reel…” magically yielding footage, or the whiplash around object state: “He poured one drop from the crystal perfume vial…” followed moments later by “placed the empty crystal perfume vial…”. The same mechanism drives duplicate possession and disappearance: on one line he “set the clock down,” on the next he’s “revealing the chess clock strapped against his heart.” The decoder favors the freshest, most striking image and doesn’t reconcile it with the last committed state, so entity tracking collapses in 1–3 sentences, especially around symbolic talismans and fast-cut beats.

Time anchors fail for the same reason. The model restates a scene in a new tense to land an epigram without rechecking the earlier anchor, yielding unsignaled flips like “Tonight the gorge hummed with a new fracture:” after a sunrise setup, or extinction rhetoric such as “The last human heartbeat on Earth had faded three winters ago” coexisting with later awakenings. When interior reflection is interleaved with external action, the system rewrites the beat in the tense that best serves the line’s rhythm, not the scene’s chronology. Even conceptual claims contradict under this pressure: the same story can assert “Time doesn't slow in crisis,” then pivot to “I've discovered why time slows,” because the sentence-level objective is aphoristic punch, not global coherence.

World-model plausibility checks are weak under lyrical pressure, so physics and biology are treated as optional unless the line explicitly announces magic. Associative image-making outruns constraint validation, so the model will write “Outside the cracked plexiglass dome, a garden spider began to spin its web…” in a submerged setting, or pair “whispered to the garden’s vacuum” with “sonar pinging through the hydrogen blossoms,” and even assert “without friction, he remained perfectly still” on a slope. The same failure shows up in vacuum set-pieces where a character “inside finds a single data cube and a note…” with no suit. These breaks cluster when the prose personifies materials or swaps environments mid-paragraph; once the metaphor flips the schema, earlier physical anchors are not re-applied.

When the text leans on rules, tools, or numbers, the model selects nouns and digits by associative proximity rather than validated function, and its closure bias invents satisfying resolutions that violate prior constraints. It treats a bureaucratic form as a dramatic talisman (“a death certificate… writing ‘safe passage’”), misapplies magical prerequisites (“…burned at both ends…,” then “igniting one end with his silver lighter…”), and handles numerals decoratively (“4-7-9 rewritten as 7-4-9”). These are not isolated slips; they share a decoder habit of optimizing for immediate payoff—specificity, symmetry, finality—without binding earlier commitments. That’s why “third path” solutions appear from nowhere and why period tech or instruments drift to near-synonyms that sound right and work wrong.

Finally, surface stability suffers at the exact moments the model chases cadence. It often stops on a rhythmic half-line, leaving endings that read like editing artifacts rather than intentional ellipses: “Together they read the,” or “The shuttle rose, trailing song instead of fire, and a thousand”. Span reuse also leaks through in duplicated fragments like “questions rhetorical questions.” These glitches are symptoms of the same underlying bias: a style-first decoder that privileges line music over syntactic and narrative completion. Across failures, the cross-cutting pattern is consistent—after a figurative turn or a high-pressure summation, the model stitches to a new image schema without bridging verbs, temporal transitions, or constraint rechecks, so state, time, physics, rules, and even grammar fall out from under the reader at the exact point the prose tries to soar.
