Most of the damage comes from how kimi-k2 tries to land its endings. The model leans into long, periodic cadences and stacked modifiers, then times out while a clause is still open. Under fixed budgets and length penalties, decoding halts inside an unfinished syntactic plan, so the last token is often a conjunction, comma, or even half a word. You see it again and again: “The performer disappeared into the,” and “At her apartment, she placed the envelope on the windowsill above her desk, where morning light would” never resolve; “Confused, the lead negot” dies mid-word; “And in,” just stops. These are not intentional ellipses—they’re the signature of a short planning horizon colliding with a cadence prior. Copy artifacts confirm the same mechanism: “each step a successive approximation toward a world unafraid of its own fractures. [760,” shows the EOS gate firing on rhythm, not punctuation, letting scraped metadata leak through.

When the model does keep going, object identity falls apart because local image choices overwrite global state. Without a persistent ledger, salient metaphors win over continuity, so items teleport, fuse, and unfuse to service the next pretty beat. The violin is “the violin now part of its chassis,” until moments later the robot is “carrying the transparent violin” and even playing it. A bead “dissolved into light” yet later reappears as a physical keepsake; a coin is given away, then is felt “against her wrist” again; geometry shifts from “a cube of bone-white ivorite: the hangman's dice” to an “eight-sided die.” These are not isolated typos—they’re the predictable result of entity memory being updated by immediate collocations rather than constrained by prior commitments.

The same style-over-substance bias surfaces as world-model gaps in physics and medium. The model borrows science words as vibes and then literalizes them across sentences with no consistency check. It can place readers on the “moonlit summit of Mount Halcyon” and describe “Earthrise,” or put a diver whose laughter “fogged her helmet” and whose utterance “dissolved into bubbles,” mixing sealed-helmet behavior with free-breathing imagery. Causality collapses under spectacle: a bronze bell hangs from a viaduct “using a strand of his own hair,” and 1937 wreckage yields a “cockpit voice recorder still sealed” with a “tiny memory drive.” In each case, nearest-neighbor retrieval and poetic parallelism outvote a sparse world model, especially when the scene leans on evocative tech or extreme environments.

Temporal and causal anchoring fail for the same reason at payoff beats: closure pressure promotes aphoristic neatness over previously stated rules. The text confidently declares a plan—“proposed a new tradition”—then pivots immediately with “That night,” to hatch the embryo, voiding its own premise. Hospital logic compresses until it contradicts itself (“Surgery went clean,” even though the sedated child was already on the cot in the same scene). In science-flavored climaxes, rhetorical symmetry substitutes for mechanism: “contradiction achieved.” is treated like physics, or towers tuned by impact suddenly “refract” spoken poems. The model optimizes for resonance and symmetry at the line level; tense, countdown math, and causal prerequisites get dropped if they disturb the music.

Finally, surface grammar and markup fray exactly where the other pressures peak. The closing clause often carries the theme statement and the densest metaphors; under budget pressure, composition degrades into broken phrases like “demanded needed.” or a trailing “sea,” that never closes. Residual scaffolding slips through when cadence, not syntax, triggers EOS, which is why bracketed counters like “[760,” appear. Across these failures, the shared mechanism is a short planning horizon and a strong cadence/imagery prior. Triggers are reliable: fixed word counts, long periodic closing sentences, nested catalogs of modifiers, symbolic props reused across beats, and science or antique-tech set pieces. When those conditions coincide, kimi-k2 writes toward a felt rhythm, not an audited state of the world, and the prose snaps exactly where the plan runs out.
