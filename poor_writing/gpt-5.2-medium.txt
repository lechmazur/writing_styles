"The harp waited in a cave… | She followed the sound out of the cave… | …laid the crocodile tooth in Elowen's palm… | Mara kept playing…"
She leaves the instrument, gives away the “pick,” and somehow keeps playing anyway.

"I turned my back on the cheers… ladder dropped to the black water… | …breathing silt…"
He’s basically scuba-diving through wreckage with zero air supply or underwater logic.

"After the missing return changed, the town of Larkspur felt like a thaw that still stung…"
This sounds deep, but it’s just not a sentence you can understand.

"“Lio arrived…” | “He wanted… to press your ear against destiny's door…” | “You arrived with the last commuters…”"
It suddenly starts talking to “you,” and nobody knows who “you” is.

"“she left the emergency locks engaged, trapping her coworkers… No one died…”"
You can’t drop a “trapped them” bomb and then hand-wave the escape with one calm sentence.

"…holding the seashell half to the microphone so its whisper filled the room with the recorded confession…"
A seashell becomes an audio player out of nowhere because the plot needs it to.

"I was retrocognitively blessed… | when I touched my chalk marks I saw tomorrow's smears"
The power is “see the past” until it suddenly becomes “see the future,” because why not.

"…two months after receiving the donor heart that saved my dyes and my life."
Unless the character is a printer, this is a glaring typo that breaks trust.

"…slipped the fob into the fishmonger's scale pan… would be found… | …she retrieved the fob…"
She leaves it for someone else to find, then magically picks it up later like it never mattered.

"…a phantom train ticket punch that had no metal body… | …snapped shut, leaving a… hole…"
It has “no body” but still clicks shut and punches holes—pick a reality.

"…pressing the vial's mouth to the relief and breathing the perfumed hush in…"
She’s underwater and on failing gear, yet somehow takes a casual breath from a wall.

"Two months after we raised Amelia Earhart's… Electra… | The recovery had made me famous for a week…"
Finding Earhart’s plane would be world news forever, not a one-week trend.

"…without it he could not prove a report that the enemy ships had turned inland."
A “compass rose” isn’t a single missing gadget that prevents “proof”—that’s not what it is.

"…a wax cylinder phonograph shaving… | …the machine releases a voice…"
You can’t play a loose curl of waste plastic like it’s a record.

"“But Eli needed a signal that no one could intercept…” | “At the first click… Eli texted…”"
He demands an un-interceptable signal, then uses regular texting like a genius.

"Though blind since childhood… | …held a glass prism… When the light split… He aligned… under that… spectrum…"
The story keeps giving a blind character super-precise visual tasks with no workaround.

"“That night I placed the small gear under my tongue…” | “...the small gear slipped from my mouth into the mechanism”"
Did he sleep holding a gear in his mouth like a trained seal, or what?

"Those consoles had been disconnected… | The dormant networks woke… sending a thin pulse…"
Disconnected means disconnected—one scan can’t wake a whole city network unless you explain how.

"When I reached Mara's slip, only her remained, and it said, I forgive you for surviving…"
The missing quotes make it unclear who’s speaking, what’s read, and what’s happening.

"“…concerts that were performed in silence…” | “In the city, people still gathered to hear strings and horns…”"
If it’s silent, there’s nothing to hear—this is a contradiction, not a vibe.

"The lock… demanded a final resolving beat… yet she deliberately broke it… and the bars swung open…"
It “demands” resolution, but the solution is refusing resolution—those rules don’t match.

"…a cracked sundial base… now buried… | …she sat against the sundial base… | …they set the sundial base on a plinth…"
The same object is buried, accessible, and displayed—apparently it teleports between sentences.

"The plate came from the tide line weeks ago, still warm…"
Weeks later and still warm is not poetic—it’s physically impossible.

"“the last strip of sun clung to the horizon” | “a few stars survived the pale morning” | “first true light…”"
This scene flips between sunset and dawn like it can’t decide what sky it’s under.

"…tracked a pale envelope sliding under a seat… | …Eli… copied the address… and sent it wrong."
An envelope can’t both slide under a seat and also be something he mailed to the wrong address.

"the boy lifted his cast and the decrypted notes projected on the wall like subtitles."
His cast is not a projector, and the story never gives him one.

"I guided Edda… pulled the bench aside, using the tightened bolt as a handle…"
A bolt isn’t a handle you grab to move furniture—this is just not how objects work.

"The airship's compass began to twitch toward the left, not north…"
A compass points to directions, not “left,” unless your compass also knows which way you’re facing.

"Mist stitched the storm-worn windblown parapet in mist to the sea…"
It repeats itself and trips over its own words before the image even lands.

"…the envelope seal had burned my fingers with a scent of salt and smoke."
A smell can’t burn your fingers—pick a sense and stick with it."
