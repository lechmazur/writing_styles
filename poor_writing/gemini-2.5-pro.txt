"This was the Kaelan Point Relay… I remembered them… | A familiar tightness gripped Elias’s chest,"
Jumps from “I” to “Elias” in the same breath—who’s telling this?

"plucking her from the minds of everyone who had ever known her. | His work for Anya had been simple, at first"
Erased from “everyone’s” mind—except the narrator’s, apparently.

"“Tonight was such a night, a full and pregnant moon…” | “…the 'broken horn' was the crescent moon…”"
One night can’t be both full moon and crescent. Pick one.

"marooned it in an endless now. | For cycles, she had been walking,"
Time can’t be frozen and also measured in cycles.

"“the only sound was the dust settling…” | “anchoring the station…in a single, perfect instant.”"
If time stops, dust doesn’t settle. Physics still applies.

"He was holding a garish pink flamingo… He hadn't bought it yet…"
He’s holding it… but hasn’t bought it? From where, the future?

"The memory of her husband’s laugh… [ intricately tangible a force as gravity."
A busted sentence with a stray bracket—meaning falls apart.

"“It was a shard of dark plastic…tape reel fragment…” | “…label…‘NANA, 1988’… she read the label”"
A tiny tape fragment doesn’t have a readable spine label.

"“the camera's shutter a soft, reverent *thump-clack* in the vacuum of his helmet.”"
Helmets aren’t vacuums, and sound doesn’t travel in one.

"“With the sharp edge of the amber… connecting circuits…”"
Amber is an insulator; it won’t magically wire a server.

"“a frozen moment… cost a colleague her life.” | “She's alive?” | “Wounded, but waiting,”"
Dead, then alive two lines later—stakes evaporate.

"This was the source… “a gentle radiance that persisted without a source…”"
It’s “the source” and “without a source” in the same breath.

"“a single, undeveloped negative… ” | “…revealing the ghostly silhouette of a face…”"
Undeveloped film doesn’t reveal faces. That’s the point.

"“broadcasted… through the very bedrock…” | “receivers crackled…” | “…communications satellite… blinked”"
Bedrock signals don’t wake random radios and a satellite.

"“airless space around him” | “warping the air around it.” | “With a steadying breath…”"
Airless scene… with air and breathing. Which is it?

"“The light of the last new moon…” | “now-gibbous moon…”"
New to gibbous in one go? You just skipped weeks.

"“Plunging his arm into the…blackness…” | “his lungs began to burn…” | “he broke the surface…”"
He dunked an arm, then resurfaces gasping? Geography broke.

"“astronomical compass” | “…steady needle.” | “He raised the compass… like a sextant…”"
It’s a magnetic compass, an “astronomical” device, and a sextant—pick a tool.

"“On the back, a short note was written in pencil.” | “…it had irrevocably blurred the ink.”"
Pencil can’t smudge ink. Basic stuff.

"“not with words, but with a feeling,” | “Three suns at dusk,” it sighed,"
Says “not words,” then quotes words. Oops.

"It is not an explosion… a silent release… Reinforced glass vaporizes, leaving a jagged doorway…"
Silent, vaporized, and jagged—all at once? Physics shrugs.

"…A soft drizzle began to fall… | …a series of dusty footprints…"
Rain and wet ground don’t make dusty footprints.

"He worked under a sun… | the twin suns began their descent | …endless sun"
One sun, then two, then one again—the sky can’t keep up.

"This was loop number 8,192… | …distilled over millennia…"
8,192 hours is about 11 months, not millennia.

"…shimmering corona now visible… | …her face illuminated by the ghostly ring of fire."
Total eclipse or annular? You can’t have both.

"The beam struck the ivory bishop… | The reflected light lanced upwards…"
Ivory chess pieces aren’t prisms or mirrors.

"“Kael’s magnetic boots clung to the basalt…” | “…centuries of patterns he had laid upon it.”"
Magnets don’t stick to basalt, and loose stones don’t hold for centuries.

"“She dropped the stone, and the trance began with the soundless splash.”"
A splash is, by definition, a sound.

"The silent hum of the transport skiff was the only lullaby…"
“Silent hum” is an oxymoron.

"Digital billboards… showed for a nanosecond the names of erased poets."
No one can read a nanosecond flash.
