"…pressed the jade cicada into his palm… | The fisherman would keep the cicada… | When she woke… the cicada had wept…"
The story hands the cicada away, then sneaks it back like it teleported.

“a thing too sharp to touch” | “add their handprints to the wet surface” | “Reed pressed her palm…”
You can’t sell “untouchable” and then have everyone touching it with no explanation.

“oxygen… would last another hour…” | “dragged her… three days later… rebreathed still half-full”
The math on her air supply doesn’t just wobble—it faceplants.

“The last note… rooftop garden…” | “The city below had no towers left…”
We’re on a skyscraper, in a city with no towers—pick one reality.

"The woman left with the envelope and the tape… | Elias picked up the tape. | He reached for the tape again."
The tape gets taken away, then keeps reappearing like a bad magic trick.

"The last *Hesperornis*… vestigial wings… | The *Hesperornis* took flight…"
Vestigial wings don’t suddenly turn into airplane mode unless you tell us why.

"“…his father’s absence…” | “Then the father clapped him on the back…”"
Dad goes from “absent” to physically present in one sentence, no doorway required.

"The canyon *inhale*—not wind…"
That missing verb ending is a pothole in the middle of a dramatic moment.

"But somewhere… Still falling. Still *initiate*."
That last word reads like a broken placeholder, not a finished sentence.

"""No,"" Lysander said, clapsing the raven’s beak shut…"
“Clapsing” isn’t a word, and it yanks the reader right out of the scene.

"“Why did the crocodile cross the river?” … “To get to the other *snide*.”"
The joke dies because the punchline is misspelled.

"And that was how you defied gravity. | One spark at a time."
The narration suddenly turns to “you” out of nowhere, like it changed channels mid-finale.

"“Inside lay the herald’s trumpet valve…” | “Blow when you’re ready.”"
A trumpet valve isn’t a trumpet—there’s nothing to blow into.

"Then he… began to carve the rope into something new… a *ladder*."
You can’t whittle rope into a ladder unless the rope is secretly wood.

"“until the blackout struck.” … “the dial’s shadow pointed true.”"
A sundial needs light—during a blackout, the shadow doesn’t show up to work.

"Tonight, the microdot film lay unspooled across his desk… | …slid the microdot into her palm."
A microdot can’t be “unspooled,” then handled like a normal-sized object.

"Lior’s gloves whirred softly… | …heat seared their skin… | They pressed a palm to the fossil."
Are they wearing gloves or not? The scene keeps changing its mind mid-touch.

"her boots leaving damp prints… | She descended… her boots leaving no prints this time"
Same boots, same stairs, same moment—suddenly no prints because the author said so.

"…left no weight behind. | …door now bearing two sets of footprints… | …where no footprints appeared."
It leaves no footprints, except when it does, except when it doesn’t.

"The diary… written not in words… | …*“The silence of a held breath,”* one read…"
You can’t hype “not in words” and then have characters literally read words.

"The automaton key lay on her workbench… | Elara slotted it… | The key on the workbench glowed…"
That key can’t be in the automaton and still chilling on the workbench.

"“the one no one had opened in years.” … “a single envelope lay half-tucked…” … “mailbox jammed shut…”"
A jammed-shut box doesn’t casually accept fresh mail and hand it over.

"“a skeleton key tag…” … “Elias pocketed the tag” … “Elias slipped the tag’s key inside.”"
A tag isn’t a key, and the story never shows where the actual key comes from.

"“hydroponic bays” … “The soil was waiting.”"
Hydroponics famously don’t use soil—this swaps the system mid-sentence.

"The disused railway station… for thirty years… | …fixed the stationmaster’s… radio… | …caught the first train… a flatbed truck…"
The setting can’t decide whether trains exist, stations exist, or words mean things.

"The cap had to be reopened… *decreased*."
“Decreased” what? This is action-writing with the crucial action missing.

"“Beautiful,” she said, though her voice was already dissolving… | But the woman in gray was still there…"
She dissolves, then immediately isn’t dissolved—so what actually happened?

"The smooth die vanished. … | …the smooth one left behind on the threshold."
It vanishes, then it’s “left behind” like it never vanished at all.

"The explosion was silent. … The penny dropped. The world remade itself around the sound."
You can’t call it silent and then hinge the moment on “the sound” without clarifying anything.

"*[The following sentences expand the atmosphere…]* | *[Final line refines the core concept.]*"
The story stops to leave itself editorial notes, and the spell breaks instantly.
