"Martha walked the midnight ridgeway at twilight, that liminal hour…"
It can’t be midnight and twilight at the same time—pick one clock.

"Three days had passed since friction disappeared… | …Meren stood, her grip sure despite the slick ground."
If friction is gone, nobody’s gripping anything “sure”—that’s literally what friction is for.

"parallel lines meeting… triangles… summing to more than one hundred eighty degrees…"
Basic geometry fail: in hyperbolic space, triangle angles add up to less than 180°, not more.

"what the old manuscripts had promised… scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner… Through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner…"
The same phrase repeats back-to-back like the editor’s asleep on the keyboard.

"""My therapist told me that. She says we all have shared anxieties…"""
This is a seven-year-old talking like a grad student in therapy.

""""Keep it," Marcus said, pressing the bishop into her palm instead. | Marcus… slipping the bishop back into his pocket."""
He gave it away, then magically still has it—pocket dimensions strike again.

"""The morning after… Esther found her first cracked marble… | '""I found my first marble here,"" Esther said. ""I was twenty-three…""'"""
Did she find her first marble yesterday or at twenty-three—because those can’t both be true.

"before the prophet's new doctrine silenced the old songs forever. | ""The prophet arrived… his eyes… He says…"""
The prophet flips from “her” to “his” mid-breath, like the story forgot who it hired.

"the shell fell silent, full to bursting… | She set the empty shell…"
Is it full or empty—because the scene can’t be both.

"Mira… balanced on the… stone chip she'd worn as a pendant since childhood…"
A pendant-sized chip can’t also be big enough to stand on with both feet.

"when she held it against the cliff wall without making contact, it left an impression…"
No contact, but it leaves an imprint—so, contact.

"…colors that no longer existed in the modern world."
If they don’t exist, you can’t see them—especially not in detail.

"She had sorted ten thousand seasons' worth… | …through decades of observation"
Ten thousand seasons is centuries; decades is not—math shouldn’t time-travel.

"…leaving behind… the key spinning… on the workbench, waiting… beneath the floorboards."
It’s on the workbench, but also under the floorboards—teleporting keys are a choice.

"""She locked the mailbox… leaving… letters sealed inside." … ""She kept Delphine's letters…"""""
Sealed in a mailbox is not the same thing as “kept”—the reveal contradicts itself.

"The hunger stone sat heavy in his satchel… | …covering the hunger stone's resting place…"
If it’s in his bag, the tide can’t be covering it outside.

"Her motivation had always been steadily unpredictable…"
“Steadily unpredictable” is just two words fighting in a hallway.

""""You are balancedly curious—not rushing, not hesitating. This is why I chose you as student.""""
“Balancedly” isn’t doing anyone favors, and neither is “as student.”

"carrying her father's silence like a engine that would never stop running."
That “a engine” typo is loud enough to break the mood by itself.

"Milo had come before they find the bodies, before the mainland patrol would arrive…"
The tense snaps in half, and “they” shows up without an introduction.

"…letting rigid thinking liquefies itself against patience."
It should be “liquefy,” and the image still doesn’t quite make sense even when fixed.

"The luminescence spread mindfully scattered across the surface…"
This reads like two sentence drafts collided at speed.

"Through progressive disclosure, the canyon had been teaching her its secrets."
“Progressive disclosure” sounds like UX documentation, not a canyon.

"Death had not ended him; it had changed his address."
A modern dad-joke cliché drops straight through a mythic moment.

"She was not lost… searching for meaning… when it had always lived in the journey."
The story pauses to hand you a greeting-card moral.

"""What if… doubt is sin?"" | …""What if doubt is sin?"""
The echo flips the meaning into the exact opposite of what he just said.

"The election happened every generation, while forests hold elections for which species…"
The grammar tangles so badly the worldbuilding idea never lands.

"The device… was simple… designed to last centuries… waterproof… endless rotation…"
A “simple” speaker that runs for centuries underwater needs more than vibes.

""""Cancel the assault. Bring your people here instead." … | …campfires… begin to move… upward…"""
An army doesn’t pivot instantly because someone said so—conflict needs friction.

"“That child… would never wake.” | …“might wake to try again.”"
The ending tries to reverse a hard “never” without earning the change.

"In her pocket rested a crystal perfume vial… three drops… | …three drops…"
If she used it, the count should change—objects don’t refill between paragraphs.

"The porcelain insulator had belonged to a telegraph line… | If porcelain could conduct electricity…"
It’s called an insulator because it doesn’t conduct—your premise eats itself.
