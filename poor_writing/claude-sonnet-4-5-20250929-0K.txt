"glass ceiling revealing a moon three-quarters full, waxing toward completion… always today, endlessly today."
If tomorrow never arrives, the moon doesn’t get to “wax” like it has a calendar.

"The distress signal had been pulsing from the ocean floor for three days… His tank had maybe twenty minutes left."
Three days underwater on twenty minutes of air is not “tense,” it’s impossible.

"Galloway emerged from the shadows, holding a lantern and a pistol… Galloway bound and following…"
You can’t jump-cut from armed standoff to “he’s tied up now” and pretend nothing happened.

"The laboratory had flooded decades ago… preserved everything perfectly… equipment still functional…"
Decades underwater doesn’t preserve electronics “perfectly” unless you explain the miracle.

"Five years since she'd written it, four since he'd tried to destroy it… three since he'd plucked it from the flames."
This timeline makes the letter both burned and rescued in the wrong order.

"She sealed her report in a new envelope, then deliberately left it unsealed."
An envelope can be sealed or unsealed, but not both in the same breath.

"The bell tuner arrived… three days before the collapse… yet week by week, something shifted."
You can’t have “week by week” change inside a story that only spans three days.

“He stood, pocketing the gear with the seventeen others”… “laying out eighteen gears”… “the nineteenth piece…”
The math keeps changing, so the puzzle feels broken instead of clever.

"Sarah had pressed it into his palm three years ago… She'd spent her final winter creating this archive…"
She can’t build a “this winter” snow archive if she died three years ago.

"He stood on the midnight ridgeway at twilight… As twilight deepened impossibly without becoming full night…"
It’s “midnight” and “twilight” and “not night” all at once—pick a sky.

"She tipped the inkwell… Mira photographed the pattern… corrupted files began highlighting in sequence."
Random spilled ink doesn’t magically turn into a precise data-recovery tool.

"The lunar observatory hung suspended above the cloud line… anchored to the mountain's peak…"
Calling it “lunar” makes readers picture the Moon, then you park it on a mountain.

“when every lamp and torch inside simultaneously died.” … “Someone will restore the generators soon.”
Torches don’t run on generators, so they don’t “die” when the power does.

"…the detached watch hand she'd carried for three years… arrived in an unmarked envelope six months ago…"
Either she’s carried it for three years or she got it six months ago—can’t be both.

"Hours passed.  Her fingers bled charcoal and chalk."
Fingers bleed blood, not art supplies.

"In the silent town below… in the absence of human声音."
That sudden Chinese word looks like a copy/paste glitch, not a stylistic choice.

"She oversees all repairs this way, examining how light bends through water…"
The story slips into present tense mid-scene like the narrator tripped.

"But Elara's true innovation was something her grandfather never attempted: she explains through dance."
One word (“explains”) yanks the narration into the wrong tense.

"The temple library had no name… its last witness had died three thousand years before the stones were laid."
How did the “last witness” die before the building even existed?

"They called her the lending library arsonist, though she had never burned a single book."
If she never burned anything, why is everyone confidently calling her an arsonist?

"…a moonstone cabochon dust speck lodged in the bark…"
A “cabochon” is a cut gemstone; a “dust speck” is not—this image fights itself.

"Maron removed his gloves… But Moran had spent years learning to touch…"
The character’s name changes mid-paragraph like an un-fixed typo.

"She readjusted her position at the marble table, now listing slightly after fifty years…"
This sentence makes it sound like she’s tilting from tidal pressure, not the building.

"In her canvas sack, truffles continued to grow… beneath the earth."
Truffles can’t be in her bag and still growing underground at the same time.

"…winter's last snow… first brave greens of spring… Outside… dusk was falling across the autumn grounds."
The season flips from spring to autumn with no transition, like the page got swapped.

"She drifted through the orchard planet's perpetual twilight  |  At dawn, she manifested…"
“Perpetual twilight” stops meaning anything once you also have dawn.

"The electromagnetic pulse fried everything… | The servers hummed, corrupted files blinking…"
If everything was fried, the servers don’t get to hum politely afterward.

"They worked through the night… When dawn broke… They'd spent weeks threading her conduits…"
Weeks of work don’t fit between “night” and “dawn.”

"The tide would reclaim these chambers twice daily.  |  She left her easel in the cave, planning to return."
Leaving your stuff in a place that floods twice a day needs at least one line of logistics.

"She pressed play.  Her father's voice emerged… Then Crenshaw's own voice… weeks ago…"
If you wanted a confession “from him,” playing an old tape isn’t it.

"Tomorrow she'd upload her resignation… Tonight, Elena Martinez archived herself… seventeen new files appeared…"
If she’s already archived tonight, “tomorrow” can’t still be on the schedule.
