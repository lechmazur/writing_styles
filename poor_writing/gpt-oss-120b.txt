"“Inside lay a tiny locket photo… and a handwritten note…” | “Together they opened the envelope, discovered…”"
The envelope gets opened twice so the scene runs on instant replays.

"Each traveler received a ticket punch with star stamp… | …required the soft pressure of a star‑stamped ticket punch to open."
A ticket punch is a tool, not a personal keepsake that also happens to be the exact key you need.

"“…a small, locked mailbox…” … “Inside, beneath faded postcards, lay an aged locket…”"
We’re told it’s locked, then we’re magically told what’s inside anyway.

"“She set a copper kettle over a fire made from salvaged solar panels, letting the water hiss…”"
Solar panels don’t burn, so this reads like “tech stuff” wallpaper, not an actual action.

"Tonight, the waning crescent pulsed faintly… | …at dawn, when the moon would rise again in its full glory."
The moon can’t go from crescent to full overnight—astronomy isn’t optional.

"“Aria… to slip into the forgotten underwater city…” | “The fireflies floated…” | “until sunrise…”"
Fireflies and sunrise don’t belong in an underwater city unless you explain the air and the sky.

"Her latest commission was a fragile elm leaf fossil… | The elk leaf fossil drifted gently…"
The key object changes species mid-sentence: elm becomes elk.

"A passerby… a weary shopkeeper who had closed his store… | She felt the ghost's longing…"
The shopkeeper flips from “his” to “She” like the character got recast mid-scene.

"Inside her sat a dove gray map case, its leather worn smooth by generations of careful hands…"
“Inside her” makes it sound like she swallowed the map case.

"The sun slipped behind the clouded moon on Sage Ridge…"
That’s not how the sky works, and it’s a rough first-line faceplant.

"The only obstacle left was an ancient piano bench… its keys scattered…"
A piano bench doesn’t have keys; you mean a piano.

"She had learned that the box could be unstick only by following breadcrumbs left by the migrating geese…"
“Could be unstick” is broken English right where the plot hinge should be clear.

"She had once been given a fortune from cookie by a wandering monk…"
“Fortune from cookie” reads like half the sentence fell out.

"She held that breath during a held breath…"
This is the same thought twice, stapled together, and it doesn’t mean anything.

"“stood the dead language tutor I had hired”"
It sounds like the tutor is a corpse, not someone who teaches Latin.

"Her daughter, Mira, clung to her daughter's hair ribbon…"
The pronouns imply Mira has a daughter, which is not what you meant.

"Mira placed the sundial back on the pedestal…  |  Mira walked toward the exit, the brass sundial clutched close…"
The sundial can’t be left behind and carried out at the same time.

"“He returned the river stone to its pedestal…” | “...the river stone cradled against his chest…”"
He puts it back—then immediately has it in his arms anyway.

"The abandoned circus train hissed along rusted rails… | And as the train rolled onward…"
If it’s abandoned, it probably shouldn’t be actively chugging down the tracks.

"The decree meant that no messenger could cross the boundary, yet a carrier pigeon's message tube hung…"
A hard ban on crossing means you can’t casually have fresh messages delivered without explanation.

"Mara, though blind… | She examined the light refraction… | …Mara kept her calm, watching…"
You can’t establish she’s blind and then keep having her visually examine and watch things.

"In his satchel lay an amber bottle with no opening… | He opened the amber bottle… the cork dissolved…"
A bottle with “no opening” shouldn’t later have an opening and a cork.

"…rig mirrors that would capture the aurora’s energy… | …plates glowed, converting light into a steady current…"
Aurora-as-battery tech shows up as a miracle, not a believable mechanism.

"He kept an empty hourglass in his pocket… | …hourglass emptied… | …the sand inside the glass began to rise…"
An “empty” hourglass can’t empty on cue and also have sand.

"…a forgotten library inside a sunken ship… deepest trench. | …the hull of the ship broke the surface…"
The ship can’t be in the deepest trench and also be breaking the surface where you can board it.

"“...coaxing a school of fish... even as the last caught fish swam upstream…”"
A caught fish doesn’t swim away unless you say it’s released or it’s a vision.

"“a single flame from an eternal candle, its light never fading.” … | … “the flame now a dim ember…”"
“Never fading” immediately fades, so the story breaks its own magic promise.

"“the tower's mechanisms stilled… tick that would never come.” | “Yet the mechanism never missed a beat…”"
The clock both stops forever and keeps perfect time—pick one reality.

"She sealed the vial with a click… | …She tucked the empty vial into her coat…"
A filled, sealed vial doesn’t turn “empty” without anyone doing anything.

"“The whirl spun a vortex that pulled the… compass into its core…” | “Mara held the compass aloft…”"
The compass gets sucked into a vortex, then reappears in her hand like it teleported."
