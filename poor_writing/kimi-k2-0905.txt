"I placed the shell on a projector’s feed reel… | …on the library’s buckled ceiling played my raw rehearsal footage—…"
A seashell isn’t a video file; this turns into magic tech for no reason.

"I had come to graft new meaning… a chunk of brain coral… when the last aid convoy shelled the reef."
Aid convoys don’t shell reefs; that’s a whiplash credibility break.

"let three drops fall onto the sandstone. | He emptied the entire vial… | …memory of three drops of ink…"
Three drops, whole vial, then back to three—pick a number.

"Outside the cracked plexiglass dome, a garden spider began to spin its web…"
It’s underwater; spiders don’t web-spin in the drink.

"…should have sent him sliding…—but without friction, he remained perfectly still"
No friction means you slip, not stick; physics isn’t optional.

"Together they read the,"
The story face‑plants mid‑sentence.

"“she needed its singular wing…” | “she drew the moth wing—…” | “…the other's twin”"
Monarch vs. moth—your “singular wing” can’t be both.

"The last human heartbeat… faded… | She had awakened… | When the hibernation vaults finally crack open…"
Extinction plus survivors equals… not extinction.

"“…lost at sea, letters never delivered” | “the letters she'd treasured were his own adolescent forgeries”"
Undelivered letters that she later treasured? Time says no.

"“With each hum… the varnish ripened…” | “He… left the cello… unvarnished—”"
Varnished then unvarnished—can’t have both.

"Whenever thunder rolled, she paused, counted seconds to the lightning…"
You see lightning first, then count to thunder, not vice versa.

"The crawl space dweller… at dawn… | Tonight, with the grid faltering…"
Dawn or tonight? Pick a time.

"Elias pressed the ash to his tongue… | …the ash inside darkened, softened, became ink."
It can’t be on his tongue and still “inside” the box.

"…three moons aligned… star of redemption hung lowest… | …as the star of redemption reached its zenith"
Lowest and zenith on the same night? Nope.

"He left both objects in the pool… | Then he’d pull out a pocket-watch…"
Left in the pool, yet somehow in his pocket—teleporting props.

"…tied the bell rope… timer would ring… | At 03:59 she pressed the switch… | Zero hour passed…"
You set up a 4:00 toll, then forget to let it toll.

“Now five dead lizards lay… | …a single segment… from each corpse | set the six ivory fragments…”
Five bodies shouldn’t make six pieces; basic math broke.

““…voice muffled by water…” | “…their breath fogging the cold water.””
People don’t chat underwater or fog liquid; that’s not how breath works.

"He marked the spot with his chalk, drawing a simple spiral on the nearest fog statue"
Chalk won’t draw on fog.

"Mara… angled the sundial toward the hidden moon; the shadow fell…"
If the moon’s hidden, it can’t cast your crucial shadow.

"…navigated by magnetic fields that no longer existed now that friction had disappeared"
No friction doesn’t erase Earth’s magnetic field; that’s nonsense.

"“Tomorrow… cleaners would find only clear liquid…” | “When dawn… cleaners would find… a star-shaped stain…”"
Two predictions; only one can be true.

"Caelus removed his vocoder… and spoke rawly… | his vocoder stuttering…"
He can’t speak without a voice, then blame a device he removed.

““…a micro-recorder holding the laughter…” | “…glued tiny scraps of the captain’s recording…””
You can’t tear a recorder into scraps.

““a thumb-sized droplet of Jurassic amber containing a human embryo” | “…refused to open” | “unstoppered the amber””
Amber isn’t a vial, and humans aren’t Jurassic.

““whispered to the garden’s vacuum” | “sonar pinging…” | “echoes returning in chords””
Sound doesn’t travel in a vacuum; sonar needs a medium.

"“carrying nothing but a wrapped bundle” | “He pulled a small hand press from his pack”"
Nothing but… plus a pack full of gear? Come on.

"“Gravity, still reversed, tugged her hair toward the earth…”"
Reversed gravity pulls away from Earth, not toward it.

"“The grave had been small, uncarved” | “her name erode into moss”"
An uncarved grave can’t display a name.

““placed the complete cursed amulet…” | “…binding her to seek the next fragment…””
If it’s “complete,” there is no “next fragment.”
