"You look like you brought more than a broken melody this time, Chaplain, she said.  |  From me…"
If people are speaking, put it in quotes—right now the reader has to do your formatting for you.

"slid into the water, cold closing over him like glass.  |  …  |  I will no longer hide behind truth, he breathed into the water"
He’s underwater for ages with zero way to breathe, then casually “breathes into the water.”

"He stood alone among the deserted marvels, listening to the new orchid light consolation."
That word pile doesn’t resolve into meaning, so the ending lands with a thud.

"It was three years after spoons bend reality in the kitchens that Lysa first saw a shadow hesitate."
The tense and timing fight each other, so we can’t tell when anything happens.

"Not crossing it, I noticed, but progressing by progressing laterally, hugging edges…"
“Progressing by progressing” reads like a copy-paste error caught on the page.

"Tonight, the detective had led him out here after the evidence disappears from the official file."
The timeline wobbles mid-sentence, so “when” this happened becomes unclear.

"He felt, dimly, to discover purpose after loss was enough, finally."
The grammar is tangled enough that the emotion gets lost in the knots.

"But slowly an insight gained tracing river foam patterns threaded through her scientific habits."
This is missing the basic “who did what,” so it reads like a broken fragment.

"The night the third star vanished, I found the workshop…  |  Outside, the second star thinned…"
The numbering contradicts itself, so the scene’s reality feels unreliable by accident.

"Marek watched her carefully…  In every telling he weaves truth carefully…"
It suddenly turns into a general essay and repeats itself, breaking the story’s spell.

"His eyes had finally closed… yet his fingers still curled… where the cast had been."
The cast teleports off his arm with no moment where it’s removed.

"His last voicemail vanished when our carrier upgraded their systems…"
You can’t build a whole emotional hook on “it vanished” and then also have it safely saved.

"The wave shimmered… flowed upward like smoke…  |  Now Mara was alone… the frozen wave…"
The wave both fully leaves and is still sitting there—pick one reality.

"Our silence was not courtesy but sentence…  |  My unpardonable silence had not been voluntary…"
The narrator says the silence was chosen, then says it wasn’t—those stakes can’t both be true.

"…received a dispatch no algorithm could decrypt…  |  According to the encrypted dispatch, the stairway…"
It’s “undecryptable” until the plot needs it to be perfectly readable.

"Your song did not fix the world; it simply let it be broken more kindly."
This is the theme spelled out like a bumper sticker, not a character talking.

"Then the staged emergency became real… and I became a crisis actor real crisis survivor in the same breath."
A missing word or punctuation turns a big moment into a sentence you have to untangle.

"The riddle was not spoken in words; it lay hidden by reading secret texts…"
It accidentally says the riddle is doing the reading, not the character.

"Everything that followed in the murmuring pavilion happened after the prophet arrives, not before."
It’s clunky, tautological, and the tense flips for no reason.

"You are late, Sir Calder, she said, her breath rising pale in the warm darkness."
Visible breath signals cold—“warm darkness” says the opposite.

"After the wind chime fell silent, Tomas stayed alone on the midnight ridgeway at twilight."
It can be midnight or twilight, but not both at once.

"Rumor said…  |  On his third day…  |  At dusk on the second day…"
The timeline hops backward mid-scene, so readers lose their footing.

"Yet his heart ached… to become visible to those who need you."
It randomly switches to “you,” like the POV fell through a trapdoor.

"The night the constellations went missing, Liora sat alone…"
That’s a huge premise—then it goes nowhere, like the story forgot its own hook.

"Across learning to trust again, she kept returning to help him feed the pigeons…"
“Across learning” isn’t how English frames time, so the line snags.

"They remembered the day it had not disappeared, how it had reappeared on their doorstep…"
Something can’t “reappear” if it never disappeared.

"…more laden with that lacy menace that threaded through her sleep like cobwebs strung with teeth."
So many stacked images fight each other that the dread turns into clutter.

"Through progressive disclosure, the canyon never gave her everything at once."
Random UX jargon drops into a lyrical scene and snaps immersion.

"and the smell etched cauterized paths through his thoughts."
“Etched” and “cauterized” are different actions, and neither fits “paths through thoughts.”

"time had not moved on, it had retrocognitively trapped the city inside itself."
Invented fancy words don’t clarify the idea—they just fog it up.

"The abandoned spaceport repair bay hummed… as the last workers left for the night."
It’s “abandoned” while it’s literally still occupied, which is… not how words work.
