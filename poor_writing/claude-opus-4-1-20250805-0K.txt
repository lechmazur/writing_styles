"Because twenty years ago… arranging the exchange that brought my grandmother home.  |  She was pregnant with my mother then  |  My grandmother lived forty years after her exchange,…"
Twenty years vs forty years vs pregnancy makes the family timeline impossible.

"She opened it, revealing not ink but ashes—a small portion she'd taken before beginning the embalming."
Ashes don’t show up before cremation; that’s not how bodies work.

"penetrated four thousand meters of seawater  |  Marina descended alone through the Pacific's crushing darkness  |  Marina's breath caught behind her diving mask.…"
A diver with a mask at 13,000 feet down is fantasy, not scuba.

"the girl emerged—seventeen, soaked… | "I was fourteen, like you are now."
She’s 17 and also “like you at 14”—pick an age.

"a kite tangled in the dead birch trees upstream... She'd retrieved it at dawn"  |  "overhead, freed from the dead birch, the decoded kite caught an updraft and soared."
You can’t free a kite that was already taken down.

"had been the last of his lineage  |  the fisherman's granddaughter, a girl of sixteen"
You can’t be the last of a line and have a granddaughter.

"the door to the mechanism room existed only during the tower's thirteenth chime  |  When that impossible chime sounded, the door would cease to exist,…"
So does the door appear at the chime or vanish at the chime?

"As full darkness claimed the sky, Kira stood at the circle's heart…  |  But tonight, in this perfect margin of daylight, Kira simply stood…"
It can’t be pitch-dark and “perfect daylight” in the same moment.

"subsonic frequencies below human hearing | The subsonic battle raged beneath human perception | Through her headphones, she heard the AI's fury—a grinding, metallic shriek"
Calls it inaudible, then lets her hear it—pick a lane.

"Tomorrow, when dawn light struck the bronze…"  |  "By dawn, the sundial's coded angles would be read…"  |  "In three hours, it would rest innocently on his desk again."
It can’t be at the sundial at dawn and back on his desk before dawn.

"Thorne carried the other fragments—seven pieces… | Thorne held out his hand, revealing six amulet fragments… | The completed amulet didn't explode…"
Seven pieces somehow become six and still “complete”—the math lies.

"When dissolved in titan blood, they would reveal all deceptions."  |  "Syln simply dropped the pellet. It shattered against stone…"
Says it needs titan blood, then it works by hitting the floor.

"The submarine research station had been abandoned for seventeen years  |  The facility's emergency lighting still functioned  |  preserved in the phase chamber's field,"
A dead, flooded station doesn’t keep the lights on for 17 years.

"conversations—actual sound waves—had been getting trapped… crystallizing…"  |  "Her grandmother's letter was there… Vera held it to the light and read:"
If sound crystallized, why are you reading a written letter?

"She had been here three months now"  |  "Six weeks to gather the materials."  |  "Eight weeks to understand their weight"  |  "Two more weeks"
Sixteen weeks is not “three months.”

"They found only an empty room, the artifact gone…  |  Her azure coat lay folded on the floor, the only proof she had ever been merely human"
It’s not “only an empty room” if her coat is sitting there.

"There," she breathed, finding it at last—a photograph of the first war, the first murder, a brother's tears falling on his victim's face."
There’s no photo of the “first war” or “first murder”—cameras weren’t there.

"The needle stopped spinning, pointing toward a color he'd never seen before: the exact shade of cerulean …"
He’s “never seen it” yet knows the exact shade—sure.

"Its coral-encrusted columns supported vaults of preserved air, where books floated in suspended animation."
Air doesn’t make books float.

"The gondola swayed gently at thirty thousand feet…  |  Ground control had given up… after she'd refused the rescue helicopters."
Helicopters don’t operate at 30,000 feet.

"Walk only when you see satellites passing," she told him. "Their shadows confuse the detection drones."
Satellites don’t cast helpful night shadows on the ground.

"Red light projected from the fragment, illuminating hidden ultraviolet paint that previous visitors would have missed."
Red light can’t reveal UV paint.

"*The seventh frame. Midnight. Come alone.*  |  Above them, the last slice of sunset vanished… taking with it the golden hour's forgiving glow."
You can’t have a midnight meetup at sunset.

"The ghost of Elisabetta Moreau, the violinist… | How she'd collapsed mid-aria, her final note hanging…"
A violinist doesn’t sing an aria.

"Elena pressed her palm against the greenhouse glass, watching the aurora… Arctic night.  |  Hours passed… the eternal Arctic summer made time irrelevant."
Aurora at night and “eternal summer” don’t happen together.

"in this abandoned shopping arcade  |  Tomorrow, rain would wash it away—the city still had rain, at least…"
Indoor marble floors don’t get washed away by rain unless the roof leaks.

"The research station hung suspended in the Atlantic's depths,  |  Mira had spent three years mapping how starlight filtered through fathoms…"
Starlight doesn’t reach deep-sea ruins.

"floating through the Tempest's breached hull  |  The library doors had held, miraculously,  |  Inside, impossibly, an air pocket had formed"
Open those “held” doors at depth and the air pocket would vanish in a rush.

"…pushing off stalactites that now hung like fangs from what had become the floor."
If the ceiling became the floor, stalactites point up, not “hang.”

"As snow continued to fall on the opal observatory  |  the galaxy wheel visible through the observatory's dome."
If it’s snowing, you can’t see the Milky Way.
