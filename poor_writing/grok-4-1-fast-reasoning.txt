"But wait, over. Need to trim? No, aim was 600-800, but counts cumulative, final must be 600-800."
The story stops so the “author” can argue with a word counter.

"Wait, too many words already? No, adjust.  |  Wait, overshot; trim in mind…"
Seeing the writer’s self-editing notes on the page kills the scene instantly.

"Word count holds at 712."
Nothing says “emotional ending” like spreadsheet chatter.

"He helped Harlan down to shelter below.  No. As dawn bled gray, Elias descended alone."
The text argues with itself, so the reader can’t tell what actually happened.

"In that quake, Elara hurled the phone into a puddle, watching it spark and die… | …dialing the authority hotline…"
You can’t dramatically destroy a phone and then immediately use it.

"Inside nestled two capsules… | …the cyanide capsule remaining. | He pressed the empty pillbox into her hand—"
If the cyanide is still in it, the pillbox isn’t “empty.”

"…he pocketed the empty wheel… …The wheel, discarded at last, spun lazily on a lily pad."
The same object is in his pocket and also outside spinning—pick one reality.

"colorblind since birth… | …content in his blindness…"
Colorblind isn’t blind, and this swaps his condition mid-sentence.

"…dropping the cast into the void… | …shoving him toward the cliff with the cast's weight…"
The cast can’t be thrown away and then reused for its weight seconds later.

"The library destabilizes perfect systems convulsed—shelves tilted…"
That random phrase makes the sentence collapse into gibberish.

"It had been mere weeks since the timeframe of after forgiving the unforgivable—…"
This is what happens when a sentence tries to run in three directions at once.

"She began the action of stitch, her holographic fingers threading luminous filaments…"
“Began the action of stitch” reads like a broken instruction manual.

"Nestled in the basalt sanctuary hugging its shore, black cliffs carved by ancient eruptions stood…"
Grammatically, the cliffs are the ones “nestled,” which is a weird mental image.

"her steps a silent grace that rippled the puddles without disturbance."
Ripples are the disturbance.

"Days blurred into weeks… | Years passed in this vigil… | Decades layered atop centuries…"
A normal human can’t stand there for centuries without food, water, or any explanation.

"With a breath, he initiated flow… | …equilibrium restored, earth cradled stars anew."
The world-ending problem gets fixed in one breath, like swatting a fly.

"…Pushing off, the gilded applique caught starlight… She tumbled through…she stood on alien soil."
She basically hops out a window and teleports to a planet.

"The facility, abandoned decades ago after a cataclysmic breach… | …breath from the recycled air…"
A breached, abandoned facility doesn’t politely keep the life support running for decades.

"…a fortune cookie, crisp and unmarked… | ""To reforge the bond beyond death…"" it proclaimed."
A random fortune cookie handing out a death-defeating recipe is pure plot vending machine.

"…a label from a poison bottle… ""Elixir of Fortune: Caution, Venom Within."" …not accident but sabotage—rival's poison…"
One muddy label doesn’t prove a rival sabotage conspiracy.

"She pricked the pad of her thumb…daubed it onto the ribbon fragment… | …He had lured her here…stabbed her… Years later…"
A dab of blood instantly downloads the entire murder case file—too convenient to believe.

"She gripped the opera glasses… the lenses amplified the hum into a beacon… | Rebel comms crackled alive…"
Opera glasses don’t turn into a galaxy-wide radio because you squint hard enough.

"She lifted the heaviest cuckoo clock weight… | …yanking the first steel cable across the gulf"
A tiny clock weight can’t haul a massive steel cable across 200 yards.

"""Behold!"" he declared…as if igniting stars rather than propane."
This is villain-monologue theater when the scene needs human dialogue.

"""I've seen that hesitation before—somatic markers from some strike of life."""
Nobody talks like a therapy textbook in casual conversation.

"Peace blossomed.  Reef-shadow joy enveloped all… Galaxy's gift fulfilled. Reef-shadow joy prevailed. Fin."
It’s just a stack of feel-good slogans where an ending should be.

"With zeal, Elias plumed a zeugma: ""Silence decorated his loops and sealed the shadow's maw."""
“Plumed a zeugma” is nonsense dressed up as cleverness.

"fleshly vibrations…igniting nerves with orgasmic clarity."
The tone swerves into unearned erotic body talk and turns the moment unintentionally goofy.

"…surfacing with lungs aflame in subdued fire."
Lungs can’t be “aflame” in “subdued fire”—it’s a contradiction pretending to be poetic.

"These beetles… twisting stems into hyperbolic curves that defied Euclidean tax ledgers."
Math and tax paperwork don’t belong in a plant-growth image, and it reads like word salad.
