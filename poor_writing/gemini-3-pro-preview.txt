"the rough texture of the gilded compass rose applique stitched over the heart.  |  realizing its needle didn't need to point…"
You can’t give a flat stitched patch a working needle two sentences later.

"The sentence read *condemned to silence*… | …transforming the word *condemned* into *commended*."
“Commended to silence” isn’t a thing—this wordplay breaks the whole premise.

""""the curse of being involuntarily truthful.""  |  ""I knew it, and I did not report it…"""
If he literally can’t lie, he can’t quietly hide the truth for months.

"powerful men like Captain Vance…  |  …Vance did not see the General; he saw…"
He gets promoted mid-paragraph with no explanation.

"…secured by a pewter mask strap that felt ancient and unyielding… | …the soft metal bending…"
The strap can’t be “unyielding” and also bend like tinfoil on cue.

"This was the specific timeframe when the story changes, shifting from a procedural…"
The narrator stops the movie to announce the genre switch.

"…signaling the drone to hover at Kaelen's temple… | …He watched, mesmerized, as Kaelen prepared his escape…"
You don’t hold someone at knifepoint and then politely spectate their getaway.

"…a slow and terrifying calcification… | …cellulose… | …intrusive xylem took over…"
He’s turning into stone—no wait, into a plant—pick one.

"the sensors reported only a flat, confusing void.  |  Instead…a chaotic, towering mountain range…"
The same data can’t be “flat void” and “towering mountains” without a reason.

"Below him, the ocean of history had already evaporated… waiting for the final wave of darkness."
If the ocean evaporated, it can’t still send one last wave.

"It confirmed the sun's position was at its zenith when the watch stopped…"
The big reveal swaps “sundial” for “watch” like the author forgot the prop.

"To navigate the blinding fog…sonar pinging. He hummed…waiting for the echo…"
Echoes don’t work in a near-vacuum, even if you hum dramatically.

"They knew that if the layout changed sufficiently, the foreclosure papers would reference coordinates that no longer existed…"
Coordinates don’t expire because you rearranged the furniture.

"She possessed a cognitive curse known as foresight hindsight only…"
That phrase sounds like a typo arguing with itself.

"A week of her life vanished…freeze the current moment for…a stolen hour.  |  Even within the frozen second…"
It’s an hour, a second, and “mere seconds” all at once—time magic needs a rulebook.

"A massive flock of grey starlings… | …the diving swifts."
The same birds can’t change species mid-flight.

"“the specific era of their tattered, non-existent clothing.”"
Clothes can’t be “tattered” if they don’t exist.

"She picked up a piece of charcoal, the tool of her former trade as an arsonist…"
Arsonists don’t wield charcoal like it’s a specialized instrument.

"…traded her capacity for joy in exchange for a crown she never lived to wear.  |  …where his sister lay sleeping."
“Never lived” suggests dead, not napping.

"…the deep ocean floor… | Tonight, the water above the dome shimmered with…the aurora borealis"
Auroras don’t shine through miles of ocean like an aquarium light.

"The frost…sublimating into a perfect vacuum of organized space."
A “vacuum of organized space” is just fancy-sounding nothing.

"On the radar, a rogue meteor…destined for incineration… | There was dust to sweep…"
If it burned up outside, there shouldn’t be indoor meteor dust to broom up.

"…the destination hidden beneath the city’s foundations. | The cavern ceilings arched miles overhead…"
A miles-tall cavern can’t fit under a city like it’s a basement.

"Sparks danced invisibly along his eyelashes, stinging his vision."
If they’re invisible, they’re not “dancing” where anyone can see them.

"…the thick, curved surface of the cobalt glass portico that separated his sanctuary…"
A portico is a porch, not a window—this word choice collapses the image.

"…battling the urge to vomit as his agoraphobia clashed violently with his fear of the enclosed…walls."
Agoraphobia is fear of open spaces, not “enclosed walls”—that’s the opposite.

"Silas adjusted the brass knuckles of his tripod…"
Tripods don’t have brass knuckles; this sounds accidentally ridiculous.

"He walked along the midnight ridgeway at twilight…"
It’s either midnight or twilight—pick a time of day.

"""The backup protocol is in the lacquer box under your desk.""  |  ""Solve this, and I will give you the lacquer box."""
A city-saving emergency plan shouldn’t be gated behind a desk riddle.

"…hung up, the threat had dissipated like mist in the morning sun."
A major threat doesn’t vanish because one phone call got awkward.

"With a defeated sigh, he loosened his grip.  Elara…lifted the case from his hands,"
The villain gives up the world-changing object after one speech, because plot convenience."
