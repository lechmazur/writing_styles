"“These weren't memories—she'd been born long after—” | “The old world had called her mad when she'd first proposed it…"
She can’t be born after the old world and also be a young academic in it.

"“Elena had swallowed a microSD card... 'It will pass through as her body... processes,' Pavel whispered.” | “At 4 AM... Mira found it…"
Dead bodies don’t keep digesting on schedule, so the whole “it’ll pass” plan collapses.

"“Thalia gasped her first breath in centuries… The ancient diving helmet cracked and fell away… Thalia swam toward it…”
You don’t “gasp” at trench depth and then casually swim—this needs a life-support bridge, not vibes.

"The painted seashell had arrived yesterday… the sender died fifteen years ago. | Thomas returning the shell, even through death's delayed post…"
A dead guy can’t mail you something 15 years later unless you explain the messenger or the mechanism.

"Her sister Vera was coming today…  |  But Silas needed Vera. His daughter."
Pick one: sister or daughter—right now the family tree is doing backflips.

"He'd weighted his pockets with stones… | He'd simply been there at dawn, floating face-down…"
If he weighed himself down with stones, he shouldn’t be floating like a pool toy.

"She carried nothing but the nautilus shell columella curl… | She reached into her satchel…"
You can’t have “nothing” and also have a satchel full of options.

"Today's lone mail drop waited in his leather satchel…  |  He had seventeen more deliveries before dawn."
Is it one delivery or eighteen? The scene can’t count.

"Three months after the birth… | …her daughter's first birthday—next week—… | …a three-month-old palm."
The baby can’t be three months old with a first birthday next week.

"After Voss left… | “What are you doing?”… Dr. Voss stood in the doorway…"
He can’t be gone and in the doorway at the same time—someone skipped a step.

"The bell tuner arrived at the ancient archway when the town still had three weeks left."
Three weeks left until what—rent, apocalypse, the county fair? The sentence doesn’t say.

"“Now it could generate subsonic frequencies…” | “The generator's pitch climbed higher… approaching… human hearing.”"
Subsonic means below hearing, so it can’t climb toward being heard without changing the premise.

"The letter arrived frozen inside a meteorite fragment… | Someone alive… had sent this message through channels…"
Is this a rock delivery or a secret network transmission? It can’t be both without explanation.

"“The wing had been her teacher for thirty years—” | “Because I gave her that same wing, twenty years ago.”"
The same wing can’t have been with her for 30 years if someone handed it over 20 years ago.

"The garden existed in perpetual dusk… | Dawn would eventually come to the garden…"
“Perpetual dusk” and “eventual dawn” cancel each other out.

"“She withdrew the blueprint drafting compass point…” | “Mara raised the compass point… watching its needle spin wildly…”"
A drafting compass doesn’t have a spinning “needle”—the object shapeshifts mid-scene.

"…playing a string quartet… Maren transcribed the lyrics encoded in the soprano line…"
A string quartet doesn’t have a soprano line, unless the violins started singing.

"…a research vessel lost in 1947, three weeks after salvage crews abandoned the search for Amelia Earhart's Lockheed."
Earhart disappeared in 1937, so this timeline is off by a whole decade.

"The sky gondola hung motionless at seventeen thousand feet, its severed tether drifting somewhere in the stratosphere below."
The stratosphere is above that altitude, and “below” makes it doubly impossible.

"“…none considered her work真 mapping at all—merely decorative stitching…”
That random “真” looks like a copy-paste glitch, not a story choice.

"…numbers and symbols embedded within the童 game's geometry."
The stray “童” reads like an encoding hiccup that yanks the reader out.

"She left everything as she found it, taking only the memory and the compass rose."
If you took the compass rose, you did not leave everything as you found it.

"“Footprints. Not hers—she hadn't walked that path yet. But they couldn't be anyone else's.”"
You can’t say “not mine” and “must be mine” in the same breath without evidence.

"Iris gave her a number—not her daughter's number, but close. One digit off… she'd reach the daughter."
Dialing a wrong number doesn’t magically reroute you to the right person.

"“Each drop took centuries to fall…” | “He watered… with three stalactite drops he'd collected in a silver thimble.”"
If each drop takes centuries, nobody is collecting three for tonight’s gardening.

"…three doctoral students now wandered… | “all seventeen of them…” | “The three students materialized…”
The headcount swings from three to seventeen to three again—stakes are impossible to track.

"Mira adjusted her headset and began singing—a wordless melody… | Mira smiled… weaving Somali phrases… then Karen words…"
“Wordless” doesn’t include “phrases” and “words”—the scene contradicts its own hook.

"Her motivation had always been singular: to press your ear against destiny's door…"
That sudden “your” snaps the POV like the narrator bumped the camera.

"The memory cut deep, but the loom spinner's face remained stoically sparkling with unshed tears…"
“Stoically sparkling” is both weird and unintentionally funny—especially on a face.

"The first message arrived on a Tuesday that tasted of ozone and burnt coffee."
Days don’t have flavors, and this reads like poetry trying too hard to be noticed.
