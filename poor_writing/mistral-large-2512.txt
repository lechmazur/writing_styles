"“its dial snapped clean off”… | “Elias reached out and turned the dial, his fingers moving with the certainty of muscle memory.”"
You can’t turn a dial the story just told us is missing.

"The tablet was gone. The runes had faded, leaving only smooth clay."
If it’s gone, we shouldn’t be watching its runes fade in real time.

"“...trapped like an insect in sap.” | “A woman stood in the shadows…”"
She’s trapped in amber and also casually standing nearby—pick one (or explain the trick).

"Elias knelt beside it, plucking a single string. … | Elias lowered the bow, the cello’s final note lingering like a sigh."
A bow teleports into his hand with no mention, like the scene got edited mid-sentence.

"“The scrimshaw… crumbled to dust.” … | “…the scrimshaw’s map now a blank stretch of bone.”"
It can’t crumble into dust and still be a solid object two paragraphs later.

"She had left behind a single clue: a whispering seashell half, its jagged edge still warm from her grip."
“Still warm” three years later is not a clue, it’s a physics emergency.

"He’d burned the photo… | Elias pulled the photographically cursed Polaroid from his pocket."
The photo is both burned and in his pocket—Schrödinger’s Polaroid.

"…examining the way the ripples bent the glow… | …in the years since he lost his sight."
He’s blind, but the story keeps using his vision as the key tool.

“He uncapped a vial of cobalt chloride… watching the blue bloom into pink as it absorbed moisture from the air.”"
On the Moon, “moisture from the air” is doing a lot of imaginary work.

"She had come to this town not to teach, but to learn. | …She had come to teach them to listen."
So she didn’t come to teach—except she did, twice.

"…decoding the way they shifted their stances… | “They never moved.”"
They “shifted” and “never moved” in the same breath, so what exactly is she observing?

"The floating rock tea ceremony platform… beneath Liora’s sandals… cool against her bare feet."
Are her feet bare or in sandals—both can’t be true at once.

"…a single cup of cold coffee. The rings on its surface were perfect… | The coffee was still wet."
Perfect dried rings and still-wet coffee don’t go together.

"…guided travelers across the Veiled Ridgeway… | …steering the ferry toward a narrow inlet."
A “ridgeway” is land; the scene is boats and water—someone swapped settings.

"The elevator hummed… stalling between floors… | She adjusted the beam of her flashlight… across the ticket booth’s ceiling."
She’s trapped in an elevator, then instantly in a ticket booth like she blink-teleported.

"…even after he’d locked his apartment door behind him. | “He stepped into the quiet courtyard…”"
He locks up, then steps into a courtyard with no transition—did he exit through a plot hole?

"“…though her hands could no longer touch the soil…” | “The words were chalked…”"
No hands, yet she’s out here writing messages like a ghost with office supplies.

"“The first key fit the cuffs at her wrists.” | “Mira’s chains clinked with every step”"
Either the key freed her or it didn’t—this matters for the escape scene.

"“By waiting actively,” he said."
That’s not a plan; it’s a motivational poster having a stroke.

"If he could find even one soul who still knew how to laugh, perhaps he could remember how himself."
The sentence trips over its own feet right when it’s trying to be heartfelt.

"Elias had once been the best bloodhound… his nose leading him to bodies…"
He’s a person, not a literal dog—unless that’s a twist you forgot to mention.

"He had come to the bunker precisely playful, as if teasing fate itself."
“Precisely playful” sounds like a robot trying to flirt.

"She followed the vibration through progressive disclosure, letting the path reveal itself one step at a time."
That’s a UX term, not a way to walk down a hallway.

"It was a moonstone cabochon dust speck, so fine it seemed to hum with its own light."
Is it a cut gemstone or a speck of dust—this noun pileup is unreadable.

"By the time he finished, the library had shrunk to the size of a coffin… | When he woke, the library was vast again…"
The room crushes him, then resets like nothing happened, with no reason why.

"Elias had climbed here for the silence… | His parachute buckle dug into his hip… the fall that had brought him here…"
Did he climb up or crash in by parachute? The story can’t decide how he arrived.

"He stood at the midnight ridgeway, the last of the twilight bleeding into the reservoir’s dark mirror below…"
It can’t be midnight and “the last of the twilight” at the same time.

"She was the last steadfast pacifist… | The last human had been born centuries ago…"
If humans ended centuries ago, this character being here now needs an explanation, not vibes.

"“stood at the edge of the abyssal plain, her breath misting in the frigid water” | “...the air thick...”"
They’re apparently underwater and also breathing air—choose your environment.

"“the seed tucked under her tongue like a secret.” … “Liora woke with a gasp, the seed now warm against her chest.”"
The seed moves from her mouth to her chest with zero action, like it used fast travel.
