"The performer disappeared into the,"
The sentence falls off a cliff—your ending literally vanishes.

"“And when the last tree bore fruit so luminous it riv”"
Cut off mid‑word; the climax trips over its own tongue.

"Confused, the lead negot"
Your negotiator didn’t finish the word, let alone the scene.

"In the optical illusion gallery, the"
The sentence stops like the power went out.

"She knew the new dawn would not be gentle; it would,"
Trailing comma, missing thought—no dawn, no payoff.

"“She had been born three days after the last human child”"
After the “last” child comes… another child? Math says no.

"“The last petal fell … at noon, … | Inside, moonlight fell through a hole in the roof…”"
High noon and moonlight at once—pick a sky.

"“moonlit summit of Mount Halcyon” | “… vacuum” | “… Earthrise”"
Earth mountain, lunar vacuum, and “Earthrise” in one scene—location: unknown.

"Across the alley, the widow in the top-floor flat was knocking on my kitchen window."
Across an alley and up a floor isn’t arm’s length.

"He hangs it from the viaduct’s central arch using a strand of his own hair twisted into a cord."
A single hair isn’t hoisting a bronze bell; physics laughs.

"“The Earhart plane surfaced intact last month… cockpit voice recorder still sealed…”"
Neat trick, since 1937 planes didn’t have voice recorders.

"“The matchbox now empty but warm in her pocket” | “She struck another match from the cryptic box…”"
Empty boxes don’t make fire.

"“whichever sign faced upward at sunrise… until the next dawn.” | “the coin had spun that night…”"
Your magic rule breaks itself before breakfast.

"“At the altar of dreams, a single moonstone sphere waited…” | “Each facet she ground away…”"
Spheres don’t have facets; that’s how spheres work.

"“The greenhouse had sunk so long ago… only the orchard's iron ribs still rose above the tide…” | “Inside the ring of shipwrecks, the ashen forge glowed…”"
Underwater greenhouse, but the forge is still burning? Sure, Jan.

"“She carried no brushes today…” | “She left her brushes and solvents on the scaffold…”"
She both didn’t have them and left them—Schrödinger’s art kit.

"“She… stepped onto the exterior gantry where wind howled…” | “Zero gravity cradled her”"
Wind doesn’t howl in a vacuum; space isn’t a breezeway.

"“He placed the dental mirror flat against the dock, glass down…” | “catching the pearl on its surface.”"
Face‑down mirror can’t catch anything on its face.

"“…felt the watch hand lodged inside its heart…” | “…the same hand torn from her mother’s wrist”"
You swapped a clock hand for a human hand mid‑sentence.

"“She opened the final jar, the one she had kept sealed for years… a bug whose light pulsed like a heartbeat.”"
A firefly sealed for years is dead, not dramatic.

"“a single monarch butterfly suspended in mid-molt.” | “the monarch… staggered in the air… then vanished into the sun.”"
Molting butterflies don’t take flight seconds later.

"“In her lab she had watched neutron stars decay through accumulated dust patterns…”"
You can’t watch neutron stars in a lab; that’s not how stars or labs work.

"“the lunar observatory above the clouds” | “Earthlight” | “the moon’s surface ripple”"
It’s either on the Moon or above Earth’s clouds—pick one.

"“She walked into the tide without speaking.” | “The keeper remembers the stranger’s voice—low, melodic…”"
Silent entry, remembered speech—can’t have both.

"“the wind chime … night had truly begun.” | “She stepped onto the midnight ridgeway at twilight”"
Night or twilight? The clock can’t be both.

"“a bird-sized light casting moving syllables in the actor’s own handwriting”"
What actor? The scene forgot to cast them.

"“…each step a successive approximation toward a world unafraid of its own fractures. [760,”"
That stray “[760” is a copy‑paste scar right on your finale.

"“the globe's last water leaps … a perfect sphere…”  “She has salvaged the snow itself…”"
It’s water, then it’s snow—your miracle can’t make up its mind.

"“They stopped where the floes thinned to black water, the place where sound travels fastest…”"
Sound travels faster in ice than water; science disagrees.

"“The unheard symphony grows louder…”"
If it’s “unheard,” it can’t grow louder—words are fighting each other.
