Kimi K2-0905 (A) vs DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner (B)
RUBRIC‑ALIGNED OVERVIEW
Across the set, A more often delivers cost‑bearing closures under held causal/hybrid lenses, integrates required elements as operative mechanisms, and sustains richer, constraint‑driven settings with original image systems. B tends to excel in orientation, procedural clarity, and clean because/therefore sequencing, but frequently resolves with lighter cost, more telling, and familiar phrasing.

RUBRIC: A ADVANTAGES
- Q2/Q4: Delivers earned, on‑page decisions with visible prices (voice surrendered, objects left behind, tools dismantled, self imprinted/erased), not just conceptual pivots.
- Q3: Settings actively constrain tactics (storm‑damaged greenhouses, caves/archives/observatories that “respond,” bridges/viaducts/basalt sanctuaries); spatial beats shape choice and the final image.
- Q5/Q6: Higher originality and motif coherence—recurring image systems (spiral/seed/ledger; silence/rosette/bell; loom/weaving; breath/stone/moon) transform function and meaning across scenes.
- Q7/Q8: Lyrical yet controlled line craft; fresh metaphors and rhythmic voltae carry pressure without relying on exposition.
- 9A–9J: Elements operate as engines—objects recur and evolve (bead, shard, compass, crown, quill, pendant), methods are enacted (coded chimes, ring‑cadences, transliteration via kaleidoscope), timeframe/attribute/tone saturate behavior and imagery.
- Q1/Q6: Motivation is dramatized through specific acts (renunciation, re‑routing a mission, planting/archiving), not merely labeled; thematic closure often re‑prices prior images.
- Q2 lens discipline: Hybrid (causal+accumulative) arcs sustain narrowing options via recurring cues (hums, timestamps, ring counts), then pivot on a decisive act.
- Q3/9G: Micro‑ecologies (fog/ice, root‑nets, arches, machinery, acoustics) impose physical/logical rules that must be learned and used to win.

RUBRIC: B ADVANTAGES
- Q2: Clearer, steadier procedural arcs; stakes and steps remain legible moment‑to‑moment with minimal inference burden.
- Q3: Orientation and spatial choreography are consistently easy to follow (vault/hinge openings, lab/console workflows, rescue pods, garden rituals).
- Q4: Because/therefore chains are clean; single decisive fixes (counter‑frequency, valve turn, plate press, seed placement) land a tidy DC beat.
- Q7: Prose restraint and syntactic regularity aid readability; low risk of opacity or misparse.
- 9F/9E: Methods are plainly demonstrated (tuning, decoding, lens focus, counterweights, stone‑signal codes), often with tool‑use clarity that reads as competence.
- Q1: Goals and constraints are stated upfront and remain visible, yielding accessible motivation throughlines.
- 9H: Time pressure (dawn, fog windows, eclipse, bells) is clearly declared and used to pace steps, even when costs stay light.
- Q3/9G: Procedural plausibility in several pieces (airship/lighthouse optics, mechanical gardens, vault mechanics) supports causal comprehension.

RUBRIC: SHARED STRENGTHS
- Both anchor who/where/when early; most scenes pass the 120‑word orientation test.
- Both consistently keep single‑POV lenses and preserve requested tones (hush/ache/nostalgia) without jarring register shifts.
- Both fulfill the element set on‑page rather than by mention; objects/methods generally touch the plot.
- Both can deliver conceptual repricing closures that reframe earlier images (witnessing over proof; patience over force).
- Both use sensory motifs (sound/echo, light/refraction, breath/hum) to align method with theme.

RUBRIC: FAILURE MODES
- A: Occasional truncations or clipped final lines undercut otherwise earned closures; scattered purple density/stacked metaphors can blur mechanics for some readers.
- A: Periodic aphoristic tells (“motivation was…”) momentarily flatten subtext; rare hand‑wavy leaps when magic asserts without an explicit limit/price.
- B: Low‑cost resolutions recur; fixes arrive cleanly with minimal resistance or tradeoff, softening escalation payoff.
- B: Tell‑heavy scaffolding (“Her motivation was…,” “core concept…”) and cliché diction reduce freshness and voice distinctness.
- B: Settings sometimes function as backdrops; environment seldom constrains or transforms tactics at the climax.
- B: Antagonistic pressure can be schematic (faceless councils/corporations) or conveniently dissipate once the mechanism is applied.

BEYOND‑RUBRIC INSIGHTS
A shows a higher risk appetite and mythic‑system inventiveness, trusting patterned image‑logic to carry consequence; it repeatedly reframes success as ethical repricing through sacrifice. B prioritizes approachability and mechanical plausibility, producing clean, classroom‑ready demonstrations of method that favor clarity over strangeness and often end in consolatory uplift.

BEYOND: DISTINCTIVES FOR A
- Sacrifice aesthetics: success costs a voice, tool, vocation, memory, or embodiment, giving closures durable aftertaste.
- Motif recursion as argument: images return in altered roles (object→instrument→altar), teaching the world’s rules by use.
- Ethical nuance: victories interrogate complicity (maps funding harm; containment as violence; truth vs. care) rather than celebrating neat wins.
- Sensory engineering: acoustics, breath, and cadence are built into prose rhythm to mirror method.
- Socio‑textural hints: institutions (bureaus, guilds, archives) are sketched via objects/practices, adding lived‑in friction without lore dumps.

BEYOND: DISTINCTIVES FOR B
- Pedagogic clarity: methods read like clean lab demos (deconstruct, calibrate, apply), suited to audiences wanting immediate grasp.
- Professional competence beats: protagonists execute with calm expertise; tools behave predictably; cause/effect stays unambiguous.
- Comfort‑read cadence: steady tone and tidy closures produce reassurance over moral ambivalence.
- Visual staging economy: single set‑piece mechanisms (press plate, turn valve, align lens) yield cinematic clarity.
- Low‑drag exposition: quick premise anchoring and minimal metaphor layering keep pages turning.

BOUNDARIES
- When to prefer A: briefs that demand operative element weave, world rules that bite, and closures with non‑reversible cost; assignments seeking original metaphor systems and ethically charged re‑pricings.
- When to prefer B: tasks requiring maximal legibility under time constraints; hard‑ish procedural scenes; didactic or instructional beats where clean method exposition and low ambiguity are priorities.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A
- Guard endgames: eliminate truncations and ensure exit images fully land; leave one concrete consequence visible in the last line.
- Thin ornament at hinge beats; let one strong image carry the turn to preserve causal clarity.
- Convert aphoristic labels (“motivation…”) into micro‑behaviors under pressure; show the pivot through action.
- When using mystical causality, surface one specific limit/price early to anchor plausibility.
- Maintain the strong setting constraints; confirm how the environment tests the method at the climax.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR B
- Raise on‑page cost: add irrecoverable tradeoffs or narrowed options before success; avoid instant “pure tone” dissolves.
- Replace scaffold tells with dramatized evidence; let behavior imply traits and themes.
- Turn settings into devices: make the room/landscape alter logistics at the peak rather than remain décor.
- Evolve motifs: recur images with changing function from scene to scene to build thematic density.
- Audit diction for stock phrasing; swap clichés for concrete, scene‑specific metaphors to sharpen voice.

FINAL VERDICT
A is the stronger writer overall: it more consistently integrates elements into consequential mechanics and lands cost‑bearing closures with original, constraint‑driven imagery, while B offers clearer procedure and accessibility but too often resolves with low cost and tell‑heavy scaffolding.
