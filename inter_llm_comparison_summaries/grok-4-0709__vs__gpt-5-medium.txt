Grok 4 (A) vs GPT-5 Medium (B)
RUBRIC‑ALIGNED OVERVIEW
Across the set, B more often delivers causally earned, cost‑bearing closures with fresh, precise prose and elements that operate as engines of choice. A is frequently clearer at initial orientation and ritual legibility, but tends to rely on telling, familiar scaffolds, and low‑priced resolutions. Both maintain consistent tones and satisfy element presence, but B integrates those elements into tactics and stakes more deeply.

RUBRIC: A ADVANTAGES
- Orientation is fast and stable; who/where/when are typically anchored within ~120 words and held without POV drift (Q2, Q7).
- Causal chains are linear and legible; ritual/method steps are spelled out and easy to follow (Q2, 9F).
- Physical object mechanics are concrete on the page (compass points, mirrors, bells, beads) and often trigger visible effects (9B, 9E).
- Spectacle and signature closure tableaux (e.g., thawed orchards, glows, portals, leviathans) create immediate sense of payoff (Q6).
- Single‑scene spatial choreography is clear—rooms, tunnels, greenhouses, and lighthouses read coherently (Q3, 9G).
- Temporal cues (geese move, frost before dawn, inversion hour) are explicit and uncomplicated, keeping clocks legible (Q4, 9H).
- Checklist compliance is reliable; required elements are rarely omitted or ambiguous (9A–J coverage).

RUBRIC: B ADVANTAGES
- Character motivation and agency are dramatized through behavior under constraint—ethics, restraint, and negotiation replace label‑telling (Q1).
- Escalation narrows options with felt cost; closures land as Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration that reprice the premise (Q2, Q4).
- Setting actively constrains tactics and choreographs action (workshop systems, rooftops, orchards, plazas), raising stakes and plausibility (Q3, 9G).
- Voice and line craft are fresher and controlled; recurring image systems evolve as arguments rather than decorate (Q7, Q8, Q5).
- Element integration is multi‑use and consequential (objects as tools, methods as procedures, tone as behavior), not token mentions (9A–J).
- Thematic cohesion arrives by enactment (e.g., patience as practice, listening as craft), not slogans (Q6, 9C).
- Methods are taught by pattern and iteration (attempt→adjust→payoff), yielding legible rule‑learning on the page (Q2, 9F).
- Temporal frames modulate cadence and choices rather than sit as timestamps (Q4, 9H).

RUBRIC: SHARED STRENGTHS
- Consistent tonal control across pieces (hush, luminous ache, restrained awe) with minimal whiplash (Q6, 9J).
- Early premise clarity and single‑POV steadiness reduce cognitive load (Q2, Q7).
- Objects and methods are present and generally operative—not mere Easter eggs (9B, 9F).
- Many closings reach a reflective, ethically minded poise rather than unexamined triumph (Q6).
- Concrete sensory anchors (stone, water, glass, rails) ground the lyric register (Q3).

RUBRIC: FAILURE MODES
- A: Tends to tell traits, methods, and theses (“core concept…,” “motivation burned…”) rather than dramatize them; pressure softens (Q1, Q6–Q8).
- A: Convenience and low‑priced wins (instant purification, quick absolution, easy reveals) undercut escalation and cost (Q2, Q4).
- A: Familiar diction and trope comfort (legendary artifacts, portals, chosen rituals) lower originality; motifs repeat without transformation (Q5, Q8).
- A: Setting often decorates rather than constrains; environments rarely force tradeoffs (Q3, 9G).
- B: Metaphor density can risk brief opacity or purple edges; occasional aphoristic lines verge on gnomic (Q7, Q8).
- B: External jeopardy is sometimes gentle; pressure accrues texturally rather than via direct opposition (Q4).
- B: A few mechanics are implied rather than fully spelled out, which may challenge highly literal readers (Q2, 9F minor).

BEYOND‑RUBRIC INSIGHTS
B repeatedly exhibits higher risk appetite: it braids civic procedure, communal labor, and ethical restraint into the fantastical, trusting readers to infer system rules and letting modest acts carry thematic weight. A excels at comfort‑fable readability and cinematic closure images, offering approachable ritual puzzles and clear causal rails, but often stops short of the messier social or ethical friction that deepens aftertaste.

BEYOND: DISTINCTIVES FOR A
- Comfort‑myth cadence: legendary scaffolds, ritual switches, and uplift tableaux produce accessible, low‑mystery arcs.
- Spectacle bias: grand images (auroras, portals, leviathans, thaw) supply memorable finishes regardless of cost calculus.
- Didactic clarity: explicit naming of concepts/tones ensures no thematic misread, at the expense of subtext.
- Ritual legibility: stepwise mechanics and tidy clocks make methods teachable at a glance.
- Single‑protagonist focus: interior arcs resolve with personal vows more than communal reconfiguration.

BEYOND: DISTINCTIVES FOR B
- Procedural ethics: patience, consent, and listening are engineered into protocols (bells, stamps, charts, letters) and social systems.
- Communal frame: first‑person plural choruses, councils, and neighbors convert motifs into shared practice.
- Image systems as logic: recurring metaphors (breath/leaf/hinge, ledger/lock/light) transform across beats to carry reasoning.
- Tactile plausibility: craft detail (tools, timings, materials) keeps the wondrous operable.
- Quiet humor/wryness: small, humane jokes relieve solemnity without puncturing tone.

BOUNDARIES
- When A does better: 
  - Rapid premise uptake and ritual clarity for readers who prefer clean, linear puzzles and immediate payoff.
  - High‑visibility finale images where catharsis matters more than nuanced reconfiguration.
  - One‑room, one‑ritual scenes needing bulletproof spatial legibility and explicit clocks.
- When B does better:
  - Stories requiring earned stakes, social texture, and element‑as‑engine integration.
  - Pieces leaning on voice originality, evolving motif lattices, and ethically charged closures.
  - Procedural or civic‑fantasy frames where setting must constrain tactics and teach rules.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A
- Replace labeled traits and theses with behavior under pressure; let choices reveal ethos (reduce “core concept” declarations).
- Price the win: introduce a forced tradeoff, visible loss, or ongoing duty at closure to strengthen cost (Q4).
- Evolve motifs: bring images back in altered roles (tool→rule→ethic) rather than repeating them verbatim (Q5).
- Let the setting bite: add environmental or institutional constraints that change tactics mid‑scene (Q3, 9G).
- Pare convenience: scaffold reveals; avoid deus‑ex rituals by showing attempts, failures, and adjustments (Q2, 9F).

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR B
- Trim metaphor density at hinge beats; favor one crisp image over stacks to maintain causal clarity (Q7–Q8).
- Sharpen external counterforce in select pieces (an opposing will, a priced permission) to intensify escalation (Q4).
- Clarify one or two key mechanics per story (what the device does, how the code operates) to anchor inference without over‑explaining (Q2, 9F).
- Vary closure texture: occasionally permit a bolder, visible sacrifice to complement the prevalent quiet poise (Q2).
- Check aphoristic drift; keep maxims earned by preceding action rather than leading it (Q8).

FINAL VERDICT
B distinguishes itself with earned, ethically textured closures, precise prose, and elements that drive choices, while A excels at clarity and ritual legibility but too often resolves with low‑cost convenience.
